        <H5>“Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.”

            Who am I?
        </H3>
        <p>
            I'm currently a software engineering student at the University of Saskatchewan, and my favorite topics are front-end web development, data structures, and algorithms. I love software that helps people solve their everyday problems, and increase their work efficiency. Programming aside, I am also a pianist, sneakerhead, gamer, music enthusiast, and my favorite hobbies are pumping iron and shooting contested threes.
