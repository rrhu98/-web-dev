    <H5>“Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.”

        Who am I?
    </H3>
    <p>
        I am a software engineering student at the University of Saskatchewan, and my favorite topics are front-end web development, data structures, and algorithms. I love software that helps people solve their problems, and specifically software that improves workflow efficiency. Programming aside, I am also a pianist, sneakerhead, hip hop enthusiast, and love to go to the gym or play basketball to stay in shape.
